# Xtreme Webframework 5

Welcome to Xtreme Webframework 5, an innovative approach to web development that focuses on separating backend (PHP) and frontend (JavaScript) logic. Our framework facilitates the generation of HTML templates directly in JavaScript, enabling a flexible and dynamic user interface.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between backend (PHP) and frontend (JavaScript).
- **PHP Traits and Autoload**: Innovative use of PHP traits and autoload mechanisms.
- **JavaScript-based UI Generation**: No server-side HTML generation, instead dynamic creation of UI elements on the client.
- **X5-Templates**: A new approach to template definition, offering flexibility and simplicity.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- JavaScript ES6 compatibility for client browsers

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the latest version.
2. Configure your web server to use `dist/.htaccess` for URL rewriting.
3. Adjust the configuration files in the `php` directory as needed.

## Structure
