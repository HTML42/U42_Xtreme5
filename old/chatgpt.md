# ChatGPT Summary: Xtreme Webframework 5

## Overview
Xtreme Webframework 5 is an innovative web development framework focusing on separating backend (PHP) and frontend (JavaScript) logic. It emphasizes JavaScript-based generation of HTML templates, offering a dynamic approach to UI development.

## Key Features
- Separates PHP backend and JavaScript frontend.
